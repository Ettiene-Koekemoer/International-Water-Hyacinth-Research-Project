These test images are gathered from:

Satellite images are from the Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) satellite constellations, with revisit times of 2-5 and 12 days respectively.

Ideally we would like to have API access to their macrophyte monitoring tools to seamlessly integrate it

For now all files have a set structure for their naming: "DATE_SATTELITE_LOCATION.png". The additional "X" at the end is to indicate that the weather was cloudy and the optical images are not useful because the hyacinth could not be located.
